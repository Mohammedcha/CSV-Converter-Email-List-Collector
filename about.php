				CSV – is a special text format, the data inside of which are separated by commas. Developed in the early 70-ies of the XX century for importing various table information and transferring bulk information between databases in text format. Each line of the file acts as one row of the database. Using the spreadsheet application, CSV files are able to be organized into cells and added to the appropriate database. The parameters of each column are separated by commas, if there are reserved symbols (for example, a semicolon or a new line), double quotes play the separator role. This allows you to freely transfer information between different programs. CSV in some cases are сalled flat files. They can be opened by most editors able to work with tables and texts, including both authentic Excel and open source utilities like Apache Open Office and Libre Office.

				XLS – is a spreadsheet created by a popular Microsoft Excel application. It includes document data that is located in cells that have a specific address. They can contain formulas, mathematical equations that are associated with information in other cells, and fixed information. It is often used for the development of graphs and charts. The format allows to store and edit a large range of parameters - images, tables, macros, types, diagrams. It has been widely used until the appearance of the 2007 version of Excel, and then it was replaced with the XMLSS extension. The information inside the XLS document is contained in a series of static-size streams, their location is described using several segment distribution tables. It differs in backwards compatibility and supports various file formats created for DOS. It is often used by web browsers to exclude the use of binary formats. The utility is included in the Microsoft office suite and, in addition to Excel, can be opened by various applications like Apache Open Office, Libre Office, adapted to Mac OS, Windows or Linux.
